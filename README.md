# 🍕 Pizza Sales Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a pizza restaurant using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Seaborn**. It is part of my internship at **BroskiesHub**, where I am working as a Python intern.

---

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from raw CSV data containing pizza orders — such as top-selling pizzas and category-wise performance.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is [pizza_sales.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nextmillionaire/pizza-sales-dataset) collected from kaggle and includes fields like:
- `order_date`
- `pizza_name`
- `pizza_category`
- `quantity`
- `total_price`

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

### ✅ Data Cleaning
- Converted `order_date` to datetime format
- Cleaned `total_price` to ensure numerical analysis
- Removed rows with invalid or missing data

### ✅ Aggregations
- Total sales by **Pizza Category**
- Monthly **Sales Trend**
- Top 10 most sold pizzas

### ✅ Visualizations
- Bar plot of sales by category
- Line chart of monthly sales
- Horizontal bar chart of top-selling pizzas
